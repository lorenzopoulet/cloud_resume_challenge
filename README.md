Welcome to my journey across the cloud resume challenge.
The cloud resume challenge is designed to help individuals learn cloud computing concepts and gain practical experience by building a resume-style website and deploying it on a cloud platform. For this purpose, I chose to use AWS as this is the platform, I am most familiar with. 
## Step 1: Get certified
The first step of this challenge is to get certified. As I already own the AWS cloud practitioner and solutions architect associate certifications, I just skipped this step.
## Step 2-3: HTML CSS
The main of goal of these steps was to create a webpage to be displayed when loading the website.
As I had a bit of previous experience with html and css I managed to create a very basic resume but it was on my opinion not very good looking. Here is what I have done:
I therefore decided to improve it to give it a more appealing look and to make it responsive. I had to pickup javascript to add a little of dynamic effects.

## STEP 4: Host a static website on S3
This part of the challenge was quick. I already hosted several static websites on S3 during the solutions architect certification training. I therefore knew how to do it so it didn’t take me long to setup the bucket permissions.

## STEP 5: Enable HTTPS
My site was now hosted on S3 and accessible with a link. However, this site was not considered as secure as it only supported http protocol. I had to setup a new ssl certificate to make it support https.
However, there was another issue. S3 static hosting doesn’t support https by default. I had to use CloudFront. The link to access the site was long and not customized at all. I therefore decided to setup CloudFront with a custom domain name and an SSL certificate generated by AWS ACM.
I could have bought the domain name directly from Route 53 but I decided to buy it from the site domains.com as I already bought a domain from them a few years ago. Once this has been done I asked for an SSL certificate to ACM for my domain name “mywebpage.site” and copy pasted the information given to my DNS record in order for the certificate to be approved. Once ready, I launched the cloudfront distribution and got the site secured.

## STEP 6: DNS
The link used to access the site was still very long and not customized. I had to point a custom domain name to the Cloudfront distribution. I could have used the DNS provider of domains.com but I don’t really like it. It can be sometimes quite slow and I preferred to centralize as much as I could in AWS for simplicity sake. I therefore decided to use route 53 for DNS. I created a new landing zone in route 53 and redirected all the traffic from domains.com DNS to route 53. I setup a CNAME record in route 53 to redirect traffic from mywebpage.site to cloudfront distribution et voilà.

## STEP 7: Javascript
This is where all the problems begin. My website was now secured with SSL and accessible from a custom domain name. One of the goal of the challenge is to create a counter in the webpage that shows how many times this page has been visited. I never used javascript before the little visual effects I added to my webpage on step 2 and 3.
I therefore had to figure out how to call APIs and how to transform data received from an API to be able to use them in variables and functions. This took me a bit of time to figure out how to do it. I looked through the javascript documentation, youtube tutorials and ChatGPT. I finally managed to get a call from POSTMAN which was a good start.
## STEP 8: Database
To keep the count of views, I had to use a database. It was recommended to use DynamoDB as this DB is serverless which means no need to provision the underlying infrastructure. It is also cheaper as you are charged based on your traffic. I created a table in DynamoDB and populated the database with a key value pair to have something to retrieve with an API call.

## STEP 9: API gateway
The challenge asked for a communication through API gateway. Has used to code with Flutter and Dart, I knew what APIs were and what an API response look like. However, I never created my own before and didn’t know the differences and had no idea how to setup one. Again, I looked a tutorial from Ania Kubow on API types on youtube and went through the API gateway documentation to build something. After doing this I was not totally convinced that what I have done was correct but I had to test it.
## STEP 10: Lambda function
To retrieve the count saved in the database I had to use a lambda function. Lambda only supports several languages to execute code and unfortunately dart was not one of them. I therefore had to use python for this. I only had an introduction to python a few years ago and had to relearn the basics.
I also discovered that to use AWS elements with python I had to use a library called boto3. I was not very familiar with python syntax but never heard of boto3 before. I struggled a lot, went through boto3 documentation started, deleted everything, started again and finally:

My API and lambda function were retrieving the count from the DynamoDB table and sending it through an URL !

## STEP 11: Source Control and CI/CD
In the previous step, I added the API url to my previously created javascript function to retrieve the number of views and to print it in my site. I had now to host my code on GitHub to add the CI/CD function. When I used to modify the site, I had to directly upload the new files to the S3 bucket, invalidate the cloudfront distribution cache for the changes to appear on the site. I add to give access to GitHub to my AWS account through an IAM role to allow it to automatically update the code that is present at the root of the S3 bucket. I had to setup permissions to allow the S3 access for the role with GET, POST,REMOVE access.

## STEP 12: Deploy everything again using Terraform
I have some basics with Terraform so I decided to chose this tool instead of SAM or CloudFormation for the deployment. Code is provided.

## STEP 13: THE END !
This project was intense. Even though I already used several services of AWS I didn’t think that creating a resume website on the cloud could be so demanding. At some points, between steps 7 and 11 I found myself stuck and had no idea how to unlock the situation. Stackoverflow and youtube are full of tutorials but some of them are not always good practices. (I saw several tutorials with people stocking their access keys in variables.) Even though I had some basics programming skills before this project, it improved my understanding of how you can combine different languages to reach a final goal.
